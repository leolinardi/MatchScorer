# MatchScorer
A project for Foundations of Computing subject, that calculates the score of a tennis match using python.

This program basically finds the total score of a tennis game.
It takes an array of 0 and 1, 0 means it's a score for Player 0 and 1 means it's a score for Player 1. From the long array, the code will then find the total score. The code will also output the total matches, the total sets and the total score for the last game, if it is incomplete.

**comp101_match.py** is the final complete program.
